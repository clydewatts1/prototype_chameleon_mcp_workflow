# **🦎 Chameleon**

**The Constitutionally Governed Autonomous Ecosystem.**

Chameleon is not just another autonomous agent framework. It is a mission-critical orchestration layer designed to bridge the gap between raw AI agency and professional-grade reliability. By enforcing a **Workflow Constitution**, Chameleon ensures that every interaction is safe, every state is traceable, and every decision is ultimately governed by a human **Pilot**.

## **🏛️ The Four Pillars of the Constitution**

Chameleon operates under a strict set of architectural "laws" that guarantee system integrity:

1. **Human-Centricity (Pilot Sovereignty):** The human is never "out of the loop." The Pilot possesses ultimate authority to pause, override, or refine any process at any time.  
2. **Atomic Units of Work (UOW):** Work is processed in discrete, stateless units. Every state transition is cryptographically verified via a state\_hash, ensuring a perfect chain of custody for your data.  
3. **Guard-Rail Governance (The Guard):** Every communication link is intercepted by automated Guards. If a proposed action violates the Constitution, it is blocked instantly—before execution.  
4. **Continuous Learning (The Librarian):** The system doesn't just execute; it evolves. The Librarian role analyzes "Shadow Logs" to propose safety-validated optimizations to the Pilot.

## **🚀 Key Features**

### **🛣️ The "Fork in the Road"**

Chameleon features a sophisticated **Interaction Policy** engine. Using advanced branching logic, the system can evaluate complex expressions—including arithmetic, boolean grouping, and functional transformations like normalize\_score(score)—to determine the optimal path for a Unit of Work.

### **🛡️ Guard-in-the-Middle (GitM)**

Unlike standard agent meshes where nodes talk directly, Chameleon enforces a "Star Topology." All traffic must pass through the Constitutional Middleware, ensuring that safety protocols are non-bypassable.

### **🔌 MCP Native**

Built on top of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, Chameleon treats human intervention and specialized tools as first-class citizens. High-fidelity telemetry is baked into every header via X-Constitutional-Context.

### **🧟 The Zombie Protocol**

Never lose a task to a "spinning" loop or a silent failure. Chameleon tracks interaction counts and heartbeats, automatically "Zombifying" stalled units for Pilot adjudication before they consume unnecessary resources.

## **🛠️ Getting Started**

To begin deploying your constitutionally aligned ecosystem, please refer to the [**Comprehensive Getting Started Guide**](https://www.google.com/search?q=docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

This guide will walk you through:

1. **Setting up the Database Bedrock** (Supports Snowflake, Databricks, Teradata, PostgreSQL, etc.).  
2. **Deploying the Guard-in-the-Middle Middleware**.  
3. **Configuring the Pilot Dashboard**.  
4. **Launching your first governed UOW**.

## **💻 Technical Foundation & Implementation**

Chameleon is designed for engineers who require deterministic outcomes from non-deterministic models. The technical implementation focuses on **stateless execution** and **cryptographic auditability**.

### **The Tech Stack**

* **Persistence:** Database-agnostic design. Optimized for high-performance engines including **Snowflake**, **Databricks**, **Teradata**, and **PostgreSQL** for flexible interaction\_policy storage and high-fidelity uow\_history audit logs.  
* **Communication:** **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for standardized tool-use and telemetry.  
* **Logic Engine:** A secure expression parser capable of handling nested boolean logic and functional pre-processing in the Guard layer.  
* **Observability:** Dual-stream telemetry using a **Shadow Logger** (Post-hoc analysis) and an **Observation Stream** (Real-time monitoring).
