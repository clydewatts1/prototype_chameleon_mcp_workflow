# **Project Roadmap & Milestones**

## **Phase 0: The Constitutional Bedrock (Governance First)**

*Goal: Establish the enforcement layer before any autonomous agents are deployed.*

* **M0.1:** Database Schema deployment with State Hashing logic.  
* **M0.2:** Constitutional Middleware (Guard-in-the-Middle) implementation.  
* **M0.3:** Cryptographic verification of the Governance Layer.

## **Phase 1: The Pilot's Wings (Human Sovereignty)**

*Goal: Ensure the Pilot has the tools to monitor and intervene.*

* **M1.1:** Operational Intervention Dashboard (Tier-1 Milestone).  
* **M1.2:** Violation Packet viewer and Emergency Brake implementation.  
* **M1.3:** First "Live Agent" tests (Single-step Sequential UOWs only).

## **Phase 2: Logical Maturity (Incremental Branching)**

*Goal: Gradually increase the complexity of the "Forks in the Road."*

* **M2.1:** Stage 1: Simple Sequential Workflows.  
* **M2.2:** Stage 2: Basic Branching (Boolean if/else).  
* **M2.3:** Stage 3: Advanced Arithmetic and Functional Interaction Policies.

## **Phase 3: Closing the Learning Loop (Continuous Evolution)**

*Goal: Deploy the Librarian to optimize the system safely.*

* **M3.1:** Shadow Log Accumulation (Observation Mode Only).  
* **M3.2:** Librarian Sandbox: Verifying Refinement Proposals against historical logs.  
* **M3.3:** Pilot-Adjudicated Learning: Live deployment of Librarian optimizations.

## **Risk Mitigation**

* **Zombie Protocol:** Active monitoring of all Phase 1-3 workflows to detect and resolve stalls immediately.  
* **Constitutional Gates:** Every milestone transition requires a signed-off "Guard Checklist."
